# 🚀 Introducing Fynder — MVP is Live! 🧩

After days of late nights, feedback loops, and caffeine-fueled iteration, I’m super excited to launch the MVP of **Fynder** — a platform built to connect problems with solutions 🔁 and solutions for relevant problems.

Think of it as a two-way discovery tool for problem-solvers, innovators, builders, and doers. (shaadi[dot]com for problems and solutions.)

---

## 🧠 What can you do on Fynder?

* **Post a problem** you're stuck on — technical, strategic, operational, or creative & search for existing relevant solutions on the platform.
* **Post a solution**, product, or service you offer — and discover real-world problems it can solve & find relevant problems as per your solution on the platform.
* **Search** for problems related to your expertise, or solutions to your current challenges.
* **Share your knowledge**, validate your ideas, or just explore the ecosystem.
